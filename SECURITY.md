- **Affected Components**: Specific modules, versions, or configurations
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential security impact and attack scenarios
- **Proof of Concept**: Steps to reproduce (without causing harm)
- **Suggested Mitigation**: Recommended fixes or workarounds
- **Discoverer Information**: Your name/organization for credit (if desired)

#### 3. **Response Timeline**
- **24 Hours**: Acknowledgment of your report
- **72 Hours**: Initial triage and severity assessment
- **1 Week**: Detailed analysis and impact assessment
- **2-4 Weeks**: Development and testing of fixes
- **Coordinated Disclosure**: Public disclosure timing agreement

### 🏆 **Security Researcher Recognition**

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve our security:

#### **Hall of Fame**
Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:
