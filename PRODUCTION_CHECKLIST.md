# Production Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Repository Preparation
- [x] All Python cache files (`__pycache__`, `*.pyc`) removed
- [x] All ML model files (`*.pkl`) removed (will be regenerated)
- [x] All log files cleaned up
- [x] Database files removed for fresh start
- [x] README.md files added to all empty directories
- [x] `.gitignore` configured for production
- [x] Deployment script created (`deploy.sh`)

### Directory Structure
- [x] `backups/` - Backup storage with README
- [x] `data/captures/` - Network packet captures with README
- [x] `data/honeypots/` - Honeypot data with README
- [x] `data/models/` - ML model storage with README
- [x] `data/reports/` - Security reports with README
- [x] `data/sandbox/` - Malware analysis with README
- [x] `data/threat_intel/` - Threat intelligence with README
- [x] `exports/` - Data exports with README
- [x] `logs/` - System logs with README
- [x] `models/` - Trained models with README
- [x] `temp/` - Temporary files with README

### Configuration
- [ ] Copy `config/config.example.yaml` to `config/config.yaml`
- [ ] Configure database settings
- [ ] Set up network interface monitoring
- [ ] Configure honeypot ports
- [ ] Set threat intelligence feeds
- [ ] Configure ML model parameters

### Environment Variables
Set these environment variables before deployment:
```bash
export SHADOWWALL_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key-here"
export SHADOWWALL_DB_PATH="data/shadowwall.db"
export SHADOWWALL_LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
export SHADOWWALL_DASHBOARD_HOST="0.0.0.0"
export SHADOWWALL_DASHBOARD_PORT="8081"
```

### Security Setup
- [ ] Generate secure secret keys
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates (if needed)
- [ ] Configure user authentication
- [ ] Set appropriate file permissions

### Network Configuration
- [ ] Ensure required ports are available:
  - 8081 (Dashboard)
  - 2200 (SSH Honeypot)
  - 8000 (HTTP Honeypot)
  - 2100 (FTP Honeypot)
- [ ] Configure network interface access
- [ ] Set up packet capture permissions

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashab-cyber/shadow-wall.git
   cd shadow-wall
   ```

2. **Run Deployment Script**
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Configure System**
   ```bash
   cp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml
   # Edit config.yaml with your settings
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   export SHADOWWALL_SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
   # Set other required variables
   ```

5. **Start System**
   ```bash
   python run_integrated.py
   ```

6. **Verify Deployment**
   - [ ] Dashboard accessible at http://localhost:8081
   - [ ] All ML models training successfully
   - [ ] Network monitoring active
   - [ ] Honeypots deployed
   - [ ] No critical errors in logs

## üìã Post-Deployment

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up log monitoring
- [ ] Configure alerting
- [ ] Monitor system performance
- [ ] Verify ML model training

### Maintenance
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Configure log rotation
- [ ] Schedule model retraining
- [ ] Plan capacity monitoring

### Documentation
- [ ] Update team on access procedures
- [ ] Document custom configurations
- [ ] Create operational runbooks
- [ ] Set up incident response procedures

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Errors**: Check file permissions on data directories
2. **Port Conflicts**: Ensure required ports are not in use
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Configuration Errors**: Verify config.yaml syntax
5. **Network Issues**: Check interface permissions for packet capture

### Support
- Check logs in `logs/` directory
- Review configuration in `config/config.yaml`
- Consult README.md and documentation files
- Check GitHub issues for known problems

## ‚úÖ Production Ready
